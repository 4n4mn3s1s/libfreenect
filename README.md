# Instalation
Hay que instalarlo todo a nivel global, no he conseguido hacerlo funcionar en venv
## 1)  Open a terminal and run the following commands


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

## 2) Install the necessary dependencies

    sudo apt-get install git-core cmake freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

## 3) Clone the libfreenect repository to your system
    git clone git://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git
## 4) Install libfreenect
    cd libfreenect
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -L ..
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib64/
## 5) To use Kinect as a non-root user do the following
    sudo adduser $USER video
    sudo adduser $USER plugdev
## 6) Also make a file with rules for the Linux device manager
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/51-kinect.rules
### Then paste the following and save
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Motor"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02b0", MODE="0666"
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Audio"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02ad", MODE="0666"
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Camera"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02ae", MODE="0666"
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Motor"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02c2", MODE="0666"
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Motor"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02be", MODE="0666"
    # ATTR{product}=="Xbox NUI Motor"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="045e", ATTR{idProduct}=="02bf", MODE="0666"
	
## 7) Log out and back in. Run the following command in a terminal to test if libfreenect is correctly installed
	freenect-glview
This should cause a window to pop up showing the depth and RGB images. Pressing ‘w’ on the keyboard causes the kinect to tilt up and pressing ‘x’ causes the kinect to tilt down. There are several other control options that are listed in the terminal when “freenect-glview” is run

## 8) In order to use the Kinect with opencv and python, the python wrappers for libfreenct need to be installed. Before doing that, install the necessary dependencies
	sudo apt-get install cython
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-numpy
## 9) Go to the directory ……./libfreenect/wrappers/python and run the following command
	sudo python setup.py install
## 10) Save the code given below as a (.py) file say (kinect_test.py)
	#import the necessary modules
	import freenect
	import cv2
	import numpy as np

	#function to get RGB image from kinect
	def get_video():
	    array,_ = freenect.sync_get_video()
	    array = cv2.cvtColor(array,cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
	    return array

	#function to get depth image from kinect
	def get_depth():
	    array,_ = freenect.sync_get_depth()
	    array = array.astype(np.uint8)
	    return array

	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    while 1:
		#get a frame from RGB camera
		frame = get_video()
		#get a frame from depth sensor
		depth = get_depth()
		#display RGB image
		cv2.imshow('RGB image',frame)
		#display depth image
		cv2.imshow('Depth image',depth)

		# quit program when 'esc' key is pressed
		k = cv2.waitKey(5) & 0xFF
		if k == 27:
		    break
	    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  ## 11) Run the above program
  	python kinect_test.py

libfreenect
===========

libfreenect is a userspace driver for the Microsoft Kinect.
It runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows and supports

- RGB and Depth Images
- Motors
- Accelerometer
- LED
- Audio

Notice: If you have the newer Kinect v2 (XBox One), use [OpenKinect/libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) instead.


# Build Instructions

To build libfreenect, you'll need

- [libusb](http://libusb.info) >= 1.0.18 (Windows needs >= 1.0.22)
- [CMake](http://cmake.org) >= 3.1.0
- [python](http://python.org) >= 2.7 or >= 3.3 (only if BUILD_PYTHON=ON or BUILD_PYTHON2=ON or BUILD_PYTHON3=ON or BUILD_REDIST_PACKAGE=OFF)

For the examples, you'll need

- OpenGL   (included with OSX)
- glut     (included with OSX)
- [pthreads-win32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/) (Windows)

## <a name="fetch-build"></a>Fetch & Build

    git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
    cd libfreenect
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -L .. # -L lists all the project options
    make

    # if you don't have `make` or don't want color output
    # cmake --build .

Use CMake options to control what gets built.
For example, to build the Python wrapper (defaults to system Python):

    cmake .. -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON
    make

Or the Python 3 wrapper:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_PYTHON3=ON
    make


You can specify a build with debug symbols:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
    # or with optimizations
    # cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

You can build .deb, .rpm, and/or .tgz packages with `cpack`:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_CPACK_DEB=ON -DBUILD_CPACK_RPM=ON -DBUILD_CPACK_TGZ=ON
    cpack

For audio support, you must upload firmware to the device.
Newer Kinect models may require audio firmware for motor and LED support.
The best method is to [insert firmware at runtime](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/issues/376#issuecomment-41211251) just after calling `freenect_init()`.

Alternately, firmware for Kinect model 1414 can be downloaded automatically by specifying:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_REDIST_PACKAGE=OFF

Note that firmware may not be legal to redistribute in your jurisdiction!

## OSX

If you don't have a package manager, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
For a manual build, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_under_OSX).

### Homebrew

    brew install libfreenect
    # or get the very latest:
    # brew install --HEAD libfreenect

### MacPorts

    sudo port install git-core cmake libusb libtool

Continue with [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build).


## Linux

Remember to install the [udev rules](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/platform/linux/udev).
For a manual build, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_on_Linux).

### Ubuntu/Debian/Mint

The version packaged in Ubuntu may be very old.
To install newer packaged builds, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Ubuntu.2FDebian).
Continue with this section for a manual build.

    sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev

    # only if you are building the examples:
    sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev

Continue with [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build).

There is also a [debian branch](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/debian) for packaging purposes.

### Gentoo Linux

There is a live ebuild for your convenience in [platform/linux/portage/dev-libs/libfreenect/](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/platform/linux/portage/dev-libs/libfreenect).

### Arch Linux

There is a [libfreenect](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfreenect) PKGBUILD in the AUR.
Alternately, the [libfreenect-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfreenect-git) PKGBUILD builds the very latest.


## Windows

As of libusb 1.0.22, [libusbK isochronous transfers](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/commit/55ced7746dd697024f2042aca009b7436892bf2b) are now supported natively.  There is no longer a need to compile a custom version of libusb.

Use [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install the libusbK driver for each device you wish to use.
Follow [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build) or use Github and CMake GUI tools.
Remember to supply paths to CMake so it can find dependencies.
For example:

    cmake .. -DLIBUSB_1_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\path\to\libusb\include" -DLIBUSB_1_LIBRARY="C:\path\to\libusb\libusb.lib"


# Wrappers

Interfaces to various languages are provided in [wrappers/](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/wrappers).
Wrappers are not guaranteed to be API stable or up to date.

- C (using a synchronous API)
- C++
- C#
- python
- ruby
- actionscript
- Java (JNA)

# Fakenect

Using fakenect, you can record a session to a directory and play it back later.

    mkdir session
    fakenect-record ./session

To use a fakenect recorded stream, just provide the fakenect lib as a pre loaded library with `LD_PRELOAD` and indicates the recorded files directory with `FAKENECT_PATH`.

- Sample with python wrappers :
```shell
    LD_PRELOAD="/usr/local/lib/fakenect/libfakenect.so" FAKENECT_PATH="./session" python ./wrappers/python/demo_cv_sync.py
```
- Sample with C bin :
```shell
    LD_PRELOAD="/usr/local/lib/fakenect/libfakenect.so" FAKENECT_PATH="./session" freenect-glview
```
